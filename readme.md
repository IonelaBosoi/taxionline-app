## Features

- User Features 
Users may book rides with ease and simplicity thanks to this online taxi booking app.  With the use of autocomplete recommendations, riders can quickly and accurately enter their pickup and destination addresses.  The software gives a comprehensive overview before confirming a journey and estimates prices based on the kind of vehicle (car, motorcycle, or autorickshaw).  Users may track their ride in real-time to view nearby drivers and their projected arrival timings, and they can rapidly confirm rides with an optional OTP verification step for enhanced protection.

- Driver Features
The software makes it possible for drivers or captains to handle rides effectively, including accepting rides, initiating excursions, and instantly updating ride status.  Additionally, administrators can keep an eye on driver availability and ride requests.  Using RESTful APIs and WebSockets for real-time updates, the backend effectively manages driver allocation, geolocation, and distance and time computations.  Fast updates, seamless operation, and a dependable taxi booking experience are all guaranteed by the mix of frontend and backend technology.
